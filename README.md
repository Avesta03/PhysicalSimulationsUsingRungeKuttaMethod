# A Variety Of Physical Simulations Using Runge-Kutta Method

Welcome to my repository - where I use the Runge-Kutta method as well as cool physics laws to create physical simulations.

I hope to also create animated charts as part of these simulations! 

Prost!

* Note: in `fluiddynamics.py`, I am aware that R-K is often only really used for time integration of ODEs, hence my attempt at formulating the system of equations into ODEs. It's a challenge I'm determined to overcome - but please, for the moment, excuse the silly blunders! Cheers.
